Welcome to  my homepage! I received my Ph.D. from Hunan Normal University in December 2023 and is currently a postdoctoral researcher at Hunan University.

My Interests
======
I am interested in graph theory, with a focus on structural properties of planar graphs and beyond-planar graphs, including $`k`$-planar graphs, Hamiltonian cycles, and matching theory.
