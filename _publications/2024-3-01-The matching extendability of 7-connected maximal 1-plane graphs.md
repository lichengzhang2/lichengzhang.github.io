A graph is 1-planar if it can be drawn in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once. A graph, together with a 1-planar drawing is called 1-plane. A graph is said to be $$k(\geq 1)$$-extendable if every matching of size $$k(\geq 1)$$ can be extended to a perfect matching. It is known that the vertex connectivity of a 1plane graph is at most 7. In this paper, we characterize the k-extendability of 7connected maximal 1-plane graphs. We show that every 7 -connected maximal 1 plane graph with even order is k-extendable for $$1 \leq k \leq 3$$. And any 7-connected maximal 1 -plane graph is not k -extendable for $$4 \leq k \leq 11$$. As for $$k \geq 12$$, any 7 connected maximal 1-plane graph with $n$ vertices is not $k$-extendable unless $$\mathrm{n}=2 \mathrm{k}$$.
