A *planar graph* is a graph that can be embedded in the plane, i.e., it can be drawn on the plane in such a way that its edges intersect only at their endpoints.  In other words, it can be drawn in such a way that no edges cross each other. Such a drawing is called a *plane graph*, or a planar embedding of the graph.  A plane graph can be defined as a planar graph with a mapping from every node to a point on a plane, and from every edge to a plane curve on that plane, such that the extreme points of each curve are the points mapped from its end nodes, and all curves are disjoint except on their extreme points.
